        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute `android:fullBackupContent` to specify an `@xml` resource which configures which files to backup. More info: https://developer.android.com/training/backup/autosyncapi.html"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts the application out of being backed up and so users can&apos;t restore data related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.&#xA;&#xA;Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application. Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."

        category="Usability"
        priority="5"
        summary="Missing `inputType`"
        explanation="Providing an `inputType` attribute on a text field improves usability because depending on the data to be input, optimized keyboards can be shown to the user (such as just digits and parentheses for a phone number). &#xA;&#xA;The lint detector also looks at the `id` of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the `id` contains the phrase `phone` or `email`), then lint will also ensure that the `inputType` contains the corresponding type attributes.&#xA;&#xA;If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this warning by setting `inputType=&quot;text&quot;`."

        message="Missing `autofillHints` attribute"
        category="Usability"
        priority="3"
        summary="Use Autofill"
        explanation="Specify an `autofillHints` attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc.&#xA;&#xA;The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined values like &apos;username&apos; for a username or &apos;creditCardNumber&apos; for a credit card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the `AUTOFILL_HINT_` constants in the `View` reference at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.&#xA;&#xA;You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an `importantForAutofill` attribute on that view or a parent view. See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantForAutofill(int)."

        explanation="Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons:&#xA;&#xA;* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)&#xA;&#xA;* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.&#xA;&#xA;There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."
